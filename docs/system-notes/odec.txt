Thanks to Paul Henkart for helping me understand the ODEC format.

ODEC .dat files are SEG-Y like files.  They use coordinate units 3,
but set the field to 0.  The x and y are IEEE float numbers.  All byte
orders are backwards.  Each trace has a trailer of 320 bytes.  I don't
have info on what is in those bytes.  There appears to be some other
sort of data between traces in some ODEC files.  Both simplesegy and sioseis
do not read past whatever it is.  Sonarweb does read the file.

Example trouble file: y0902-01.dat.bz2

The text header is EBCDIC format.

To read the format, you need to add these options for byte swapping and trace trailer:

-B -T 320

e.g.

segy-info -t -b -B -T 320 y1104-02.dat 

This may be tre trailer...

char syncMark[4];  /* Record preamble sync mark ASCII "SYNC" */
