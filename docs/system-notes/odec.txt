Thanks to Paul Henkart for helping me understand the ODEC format.

ODEC .dat files are SEG-Y like files.  They use coordinate unites 3,
but set the field to 0.  The x and y are IEEE float numbers.  All byte
orders are backwards.  Each trace has a trailer of 320 bytes.  I don't
have info on what is in those bytes.

The text header is EBCDIC format.

To read the format, you need to add these options for byte swapping and trace trailer:

-B -T 320

e.g.

segy-info -t -b -B -T 320 y1104-02.dat
